# TCoMX - version v1.0

## Introduction
The TCoMX is a Matlab®(The MathWorks,Inc, Natwick, MA, USA) library which has been developed at the Medical Physics Department of the Veneto Instute of Oncology (IOV-IRCCS). The purpose was to provide a universal tool for the extraction of complexity metrics from TomoTherapy® plans. All the metrics found in literature are included. Furthermore, an intensive work has been performed to extend the definition of the existing metrics as well as to develop new ones. 
In the version v1.0 the library allows to extract up to 33 different metrics. Additionaly, 
some of them are provided with one or more parameters that can be arbitrary and easily tuned by the user before the execution.
The library is compatible with the latest versions of the two Therapy Planning System that can currently be used for ThomoTherapy® planning: Precision v .... and RayStation v ...
The library can be used both on Windows and Linux Ubuntu operative systems.
