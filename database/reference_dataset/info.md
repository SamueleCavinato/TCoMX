# Reference dataset
This reference dataset is composed by 18 anonymized DICOM RT-
PLAN files (9 Precision, 9 RayStation). You can use it to test the TCoMX library. 

## IMPORTANT
The 'TPS' name in a few PRECISION plans is 'RAYSTATION'. It is simply due to the fact that they where imported into RayStation before being saved. Please notice that this DOES NOT mean they they were planned using RAYSTATION. The plans were realized on PRECISION.
